|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sophisticated Attacks            | Sophisticated attacks are complex, making them difficult to detect and thwart. Sophisticated attacks:  Use common internet tools and protocols, making it difficult to distinguish an attack from legitimate traffic. Vary their behavior, making the same attack appear differently each time.                                                                                               |
| Proliferation of Attack Software | A wide variety of attack tools are available on the internet, allowing anyone with a moderate level of technical knowledge to download the tools and run an attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Attack Scale and Velocity        | The scale and velocity of an attack can grow to millions of computers in a matter of minutes or days due to its ability to proliferate on the internet. Because modern attacks are not limited to user interactions, such as using a floppy disk, to spread an attack from machine to machine, the attacks often affect very large numbers of computers in a relatively short amount of time. |

| Layered security       | A security approach that combines multiple security controls and defenses to create a cumulative effect. For example, you can encrypt data on a hard drive. But that hard drive can also be inside a workstation that contains a host-based firewall and anti-malware software. And that workstation could be physically secured to a desk inside a locked office, which is inside a controlled-access building, which is surrounded by a fence. Layered security is a systematic approach to organizational security, identifies the best protection solution for each security layer, so if necessary, each layer can effectively stand on its own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Layered security model | A security approach that defines seven layers of security. **Policies/Procedures/Awareness:** user education, manageable network plans, employee onboarding and off-boarding, application development policies, third-party integration policies, general employment and user management policies **Physical:** fences, door locks, mantraps, turnstiles, device locks, server cages, cameras, motion detectors, and environmental controls. **Perimeter:** network's perimeter defense. DDOS/DNS attacks, Firewall configs, ACLs, wireless network security. **Network:** identify when an intrusion occurs. Install and configure switches and routers, implement VLANs, perform penetration testing, and utilize virtualization. **Host:** each individual workstation, laptop, and mobile device. The Host layer includes log management, OS hardening, patch management and implementation, auditing, and even malware and password attacks. **Application:** Applications. It also deals with how users access applications and resources. As such, it deals with authentication and authorization, user management, group policies, and even web application security **Data:** Store data properly, destroy data, and classify data. Cryptography and securing data transmissions. Attacks and Defenses. **Make EVERY obstacle count**. |
