2.1 Understanding Attacks
Term	Definition
Targeted attack	Nightmare scenario. Methodical, multiple parties loaded for bear. All the expensive, resource intensive toys.
Opportunistic attack	smash and grab, little to no concealment. Automated, wide-ranging sweep: 
•	old software
•	exposed ports
•	default configs
Insider	A threat agent who has authorized access to an organization and either intentionally or unintentionally carries out an attack.
Internal:competitor hires a spy that gets a job at your company. This new employee then exploits any internal vulnerabilities available and steals information for their client. 
External: competitor hires a spy to attack a company from the outside by exploiting any existing external vulnerabilities and returning the information to their client. 
Competitor	Giant corporations, non-profit, private, and even smaller companies. 	
Hacker	Any threat agent who uses technical knowledge to bypass security, exploit a vulnerability, and gain access to protected information.
Cybercriminal	A subcategory of hacker threat agents. Cybercriminals are willing to take more risks and use more extreme tactics for financial gain.
Nation state	A sovereign state threat agent that may wage an all-out war on a target and have significant resources for the attack.
Internal threat	A threat from authorized individuals (insiders) who exploit assigned privileges and inside information to carry out an attack. Most dangerous and overlooked threat actors. Employees and anyone with access. 
External threat	A threat from individuals or groups not associated with the organization, who seek to gain unauthorized access to data.
Persistent threat	A threat that seeks to gain access to a network and remain there undetected.
Non-persistent threat	A threat that focuses on getting into a system and stealing information. It is usually a one-time event, so the attacker is not concerned with detection.
Open-source intelligence (OSINT)	Information that is readily available to the public and doesn't require any type of malicious activity to obtain.
White hat	A skilled hacker who uses skills and knowledge for defensive purposes only. The white hat hacker interacts only with systems for which express access permission is given.
Black hat	A skilled hacker who uses skills and knowledge for illegal or malicious purposes.
Gray hat	A skilled hacker who falls in the middle of white hat and black hat hackers. The gray hat may cross the line of what is ethical, but usually has good intentions and isn’t malicious like a black hat hacker.
Ransomware	An attacker will gain access to a system, plant a virus that encrypts all user data, and demand a payment for decryption. Follow security best practice for defense.
APT	Advanced Persistent Threat, stealthy, usually nation-state attacker. Extended infiltration and constant exfiltration.
•	Stuxnet is a well-known APT attack. It's a malicious computer worm specifically designed to target SCADA systems. It was created to target industrial centrifuges used by the Iranian nuclear program. 
Shadow IT	Unauthorized/contraband hardware or software used in the workplace without the knowledge of the IT department. Example: Cloud services
Shadow IT applications and services are managed by the third parties who created them. Their standards != yours.

•	Protect your network and minimize your attack surface. Make them fight for every inch.
•	Everyone is a potential threat: Anger, Bribery, Theft, and Stupidity.
•	Stupidity is powerful, and WILL cause continuous damage.
•	Nearly all attackers value stealth(unless opportunistic)
Threat Agents Overview
Attribute	Description
Internal vs. external	•	Internal threat agents are authorized individuals that carry out an attack by exploiting their inherent privileges. This category includes employees (both current and former), janitors, security guards, and even customers.
•	External threat agents are individuals or groups that attack a network from the outside and seek to gain unauthorized access to data.
Persistent vs. non-persistent	•	The goal of persistent threats is to gain access to a network and retain access undetected. With this type of threat, attackers go to great lengths to hide their tracks and presence in the network.
•	The goal of non-persistent threats is to get into a system and steal information. The attack is usually a one-time event. The attacker typically doesn't care if the attack is noticed.
An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a type of persistent threat carried out by a nation state. An APT has the goal of continually stealing information without being detected. The tactics used are much more advanced than a traditional persistent threat.
Open-source intelligence (OSINT)	Before carrying out an attack, a threat actor typically gathers open-source intelligence (OSINT) about the target. OSINT is information that is readily available to the public and doesn't require any type of malicious activity to obtain. Sources of OSINT include the following: 
•	Media (newspapers, magazines, advertisements)
•	Internet (websites, blogs, social media)
•	Public government data (public reports, hearings, press conferences, speeches)
•	Professional and academic publications (journals, academic papers, dissertations)
Types of Threat Actors
Threat actor type	Description
Insider	An insider is any individual who has authorized access to an organization and either intentionally or unintentionally carries out an attack. The most common type of insider is a full-time employee; however, other inside actors include customers, janitors, security guards, and even former employees. Possible motives for an insider threat actor can include: 
•	Disgruntlement with an employer
•	Bribery by a competitor
•	Personal financial gain
Because insiders are one of the most dangerous and overlooked threats to an organization, you need to take the appropriate steps to protect against them. 
•	Require mandatory vacations.
•	Create and follow onboarding and off-boarding procedures.
•	Employ the principal of least privilege.
•	Have appropriate physical security controls in place.
•	Require security awareness training that is tailored for the role of the employee (role-based awareness training). Typical roles include: 
o	Data owner
o	System administrator
o	System owner
o	User
o	Privileged user
o	Executive user
Sometimes an employee can become an insider threat actor without knowing it. This is known as an unintentional insider threat actor. Proper security training can help protect against unintentional insider threat actors.
White hat	A skilled hacker who uses knowledge and skills only for defensive purposes. A white hat hacker obtains explicit permission to interact a system or systems. These are the ethical hackers.
Black hat	This hacker is also very skilled, but uses knowledge and skills for illegal or malicious purposes. A black hat is also known as a cracker. They are highly unethical.
Gray hat	The gray hat hacker falls in the middle of the white hat and black hat hackers. The gray hat may cross the line of what is ethical, but usually has good intentions and isn't malicious like a black hat hacker.
Script kiddie	A script kiddie is an individual who carries out an attack by using scripts or programs written by more advanced hackers. Script kiddies typically lack the skills and sophistication of legitimate hackers. Script kiddies are usually motivated by the chance to impress their friends or garner attention in the hacking community. 
Because script kiddies lack knowledge and sophistication, their attacks often seek to exploit well-known vulnerabilities in systems. As such, defending against script kiddies involves keeping systems up-to-date and using standard security practices.
Hacktivist	A hacktivist is any individual whose attacks are politically motivated. Instead of seeking financial gain, hacktivists are looking to defame; shed light on; or cripple an organization or government. Often times, hacktivists work alone. Occasionally, they create unified groups of like-minded hackers. For example, the website wikileaks.org is a repository of leaked government secrets, some of which have been obtain by hacktivists.
Organized Crime	An organized crime threat actor consists of a group of cybercriminals whose main goal is financial gain. Attacks carried out by organized crime groups can last several months, are well-funded, and are extremely sophisticated. A common tactic used by organized crime is a targeted phishing campaign. Once access is gained, the group will either steal data and threaten to release it, or use ransomware to hold data hostage. 
Due to the level of sophistication and amount of funding, attacks from organized crime groups are extremely hard to protect against. In many cases, it's simply a matter of time until a data breach occurs or ransomware takes hold. Because of this, many companies that need immediate access to their data (such as hospitals and financial institutions) stockpile digital currency in case of an attack. Specific protections against organized crime threat actors include:
•	Proper user security training
•	Implementing email filtering systems
•	Properly secure and stored data backups
In July 2017, an organized crime group hacked HBO's network and stole a purported 1.5 terabytes of data. The group then demanded HBO pay it a hefty ransom in bitcoins, or it would release the data to the public.
Nation state	A nation state is the most organized, well-funded, and dangerous type of threat actor. There are two primary motives for nation state attacks (also called state-sponsored attacks). 
•	Obtaining information - some attacks seek to obtain sensitive information, such as government secrets. These attacks usually target organizations that have government contracts or the government systems themselves. Attacks motivated by information gathering are considered a type of APT, because the goal is to remain in the system undetected.
•	Crippling systems - some attacks seek to cripple the target's network or infrastructure. For example, an attack could target a city's power grid or water system. 
In 2010, a malicious computer worm called Stuxnet was discovered. The worm was designed to target industrial centrifuges used by the Iranian nuclear program. Stuxnet is thought to be a state-sponsored attack because its code was so large and complex that it would have required huge amounts of funding and resources to create.
Nation states use many attack vectors and unknown exploits. Defending against them involves building a comprehensive security approach that uses all aspects of threat prevention and protection.
Competitor	A competitor threat actor carries out attacks on behalf of an organization and targets competing companies. For example, a payment processing company could hire someone to carry out a DDoS attack on a competing payment processing company to force users to choose the attacker's product. The motive behind such attacks include financial gain, competitor defamation, or stealing industry secrets.
The term hacker is a catch-all term used to describe any individual who uses technical knowledge to gain unauthorized access to an organization.
attention. bragging rights. thrill of hacking



2.1.5 Attack and Defense Strategy Overview
Attack Strategies
Strategy	Description
Perform reconnaissance	Reconnaissance is the process of gathering information about an organization, 
probe the target computer system or target network for vulnerabilities. gather information. hardware and network configurations. individual users and their susceptibility. use different tools
Use social engineering	Social engineering is the process of manipulating others into providing sensitive information. Social engineering tactics include: 
•	Intimidation
•	Sympathy
gather information about the users on the system. dumpster dive
call individual users,intimidate them enough to give out important information. An attacker will try to sound like someone who has authority in the organization. They'll threaten employees with discipline to acquire sensitive information. 
sympathetic approach. pretend to be a fellow employee in a desperate situation that can only be rectified by certain information. 
aggressive emails, texts, or messages on social media to gain information. 

Use technical approaches	A technical approach to obtaining information includes using software or utilities to find vulnerabilities in a system. Methods often used by hackers are: 
•	Port scan, with the utility (nmap) An open port on a system represents a potential hole that can be exploited. 
•	Ping sweep attacking system sends a ping, or an ICMP echo request, to a range of IP addresses—"say 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. Any valid IP address configured to respond to ping requests will respond with an ICMP echo reply packet. This tells an attacker which IP addresses are active and available on the network. 

Breach the system	A breach is the penetration of system defenses. It is often achieved by using information gathered by through reconnaissance.
If social engineering exploit, to use the data gathered from the user, or get a user to do something for them. 
If technical exploit, then might try to cause an exception error with a buffer overflow that gives them access to the system. They might identify an open port on a network server and try to exploit it. They might try to use password-cracking software to crack a password. 

Escalate privileges	Escalating privileges is a primary objective of an attacker. Once an attacker has breached the system, obtaining higher privileges allows the attacker to access more information and gain greater control within the system. most user accounts don't have high-level privileges. many involve exploiting weaknesses in the system's design. 
set up their own user account.  create a user account that looks the same as a user account that already exists.
Create a backdoor	Creating a backdoor is an alternative method of accessing an application or operating system for troubleshooting. Hackers often create backdoors to exploit a system without being detected.
Stage computers	Staging a computer involves preparing it to perform additional tasks in the attack, such as installing software designed to attack other systems. This is an optional step.
Exploit vulnerabilities	An exploitation takes advantage of known vulnerabilities in software and systems. Once a vulnerability has been exploited, an attacker can often: 
•	Steal information
•	Deny services
•	Crash systems
•	Modify/alter information

Defense methodologies
General defense methodologies include the following items:
Methodology	Description
Layering	Layering involves implementing multiple security strategies to protect the same asset. Defense in depth or security in depth is based on the premise that no single layer is completely effective in securing assets. The most secure system/network has many layers of security and eliminates single points of failure.
Principle of least privilege	The principle of least privilege states that users or groups are given only the access they need to do their jobs and nothing more. When assigning privileges, be aware that it is often easier to give a user more access when it is needed than to take away privileges that have already been granted.

-beware of shared folders
Variety	Defensive layers should incorporate a variety of methods. Implementing multiple layers of the same defense does not provide adequate protection against attacks.
Randomness	Randomness in security is the constant change in personal habits and passwords to prevent predictable behavior. This includes password change intervals.
Simplicity	Security measures should provide protection, but not be so complex that it is difficult to understand and use them.
Obscure Information	make the reconnaissance process unreliable and unpredictable. make it so ping sweeps don't work. configuring a host-based firewall on every system and configuring that firewall not to respond to ICMP Echo requests.
Most attackers are LAZY
Make sure you system/network is not a target of opportunity. Might get jacked anyway.












2.2 Malware
Term	Definition
Malware	Software designed to take over or damage a computer without the user's knowledge or approval.
Virus	A program that attempts to damage a computer system and replicate itself to other computer systems.
Worm	A self-replicating malware program. Travels and spreads by itself. Avoid by patching.
Trojan horse	A malicious program that is disguised as legitimate or desirable software.
Not self-replicating like a worm, Not attached to file like a virus.
Firewall blocking uncommon ports often prevents the hacker from connecting.
Zombie	A computer that is infected with malware and is controlled by a command and control center called a zombie master.
Botnet	A group of zombie computers that are commanded from a central control infrastructure.

A bot is a computer infected with a Trojan that allows software updates remotely. Bots commonly use IRC channels to communicate with the bot master, the hacker.
spamming, committing click fraud, and performing distributed denial-of-service attacks. 
examine firewall logs to determine if it's acting as a bot. Check for outgoing traffic through the wall.
Rootkit	A set of programs that allows attackers to maintain hidden, administrator-level access to a computer. rootkits. hides in the system and alters the system's processes and registry entries. A rootkit is almost invisible. It resides below antivirus software detection. This makes it difficult to detect and very dangerous. Special Anti-rootkit software can help detect rootkits. 

Logic bomb	Malware designed to execute only under predefined conditions.
Spyware	Software installed without the user's consent or knowledge and is designed to intercept or take partial control of the user's computer. often collects personal information about the user, like internet surfing habits and passwords. It uses tracking cookies to collect information about the user's activities and report it to the hacker. It can also interfere with a user's control in other ways, such as installing additional software, changing computer settings, and redirecting web browsers.
Adware	Malware that monitors a user's personal preferences and sends pop-up ads that match those preferences.
Ransomware	Malware that denies access to a computer system until the user pays a ransom. there's no guarantee that the hacker will actually send the decryption key once the victim's paid for it. There's also no guarantee that the victim will pay the ransom. If they have a backup still intact, they may choose not to pay.
Scareware	A scam to fool a user into thinking there is some form of malware on the system.
Crimeware	Malware designed to perpetrate identity theft. It allows a hacker access to online accounts at financial services, such as banks and online retailers. Hackers use the information gathered by crimeware to remove funds from those accounts or make unauthorized transactions. It often contains key loggers and other software to obtain passwords.
Crypto-malware	Crypto-malware is gaining popularity. The difference between ransomware and cryptomalware is that crypto operates quietly in the background and keeps going indefinitely until it's noticed. This is called cryptomining. Mining cryptocurrency wears down a system substantially. It eats up bandwidth and processing power, which slows the system down and affects productivity. If it goes on long enough it can even cause graphic cards to die, processors to burn out, and memory to act unpredictably. 

Remote access 
Trojan (RAT)	Malware that includes a back door to allow a hacker administrative control over the target computer. Use firewall to block uncommon ports. 
Hacker	A person who commits crimes through gaining unauthorized access to computer systems.
Cracker	A person actively engaged in developing and distributing worms, Trojans, and viruses; engaging in probing and reconnaissance activities; creating toolkits so that others can hack known vulnerabilities; and/or cracking protective measures.
Script kiddy	A less-skilled hacker who often relies on automated tools or scripts written by crackers to scan systems and exploit weaknesses.
Potentially unwanted program 
(PUP)	A PUP is a software inadvertently installed that contains adware, installs toolbars, or has other objectives. A PUP is different from malware because the user consents to downloading it. If a user downloads a program from the internet but forgets to read the download agreement, they may end up downloading additional unwanted programs. A few signs that you have PUPs on your computer include browser popups recommending fake updates or other software, web pages displaying improperly, and ads appearing where they shouldn't.
Fileless virus	A fileless virus uses legitimate programs to infect a computer. Because it doesn't rely on files, it leaves no footprint, making it undetectable by most antivirus, whitelisting, and other traditional endpoint security solutions. Fileless malware isn't a traditional virus, but it works in a similar way by operating in memory.
Best Practices	•	use latest version and patch level for web browsers and OS, 
•	install antivirus, anti-spyware, anti-rootkit, and personal firewall software. keep definitions up to date. 
•	Use pop-up blockesr to prevent adware. 
•	Use software to control cookies. 
•	Schedule regular scans for malware. 
•	Quarantine or delete the malicious software. 
•	repair post infection, reinstall applications or OS. 
•	image your operating systems 




2.3 Social Engineering
Term	Definition
Social engineering	Attacker uses human tactics to trick their victim, convince them to do things, or make them give out information they wouldn't under normal circumstances. 
•	Tactics: moral obligation, innate human trust, threatening, asking for very little, and using ignorance

Education minimizes impact

Footprinting	uses social engineering to obtain as much information as possible about an organization.
Pretexting	fictitious scenario to persuade someone to perform an action or give information.
Elicitation	technique to extract information from a target without arousing suspicion.
Preloading	influencing a target’s thoughts, opinions, and emotions before something happens.
SMiShing	phishing through an SMS message, tricking a user to download a virus, Trojan horse, or malware onto a cell phone.
Impersonation	Pretending to be somebody else and approaching a target to extract information.
SPIM	SPIM is similar to spam, but the malicious link is sent to the target over instant messaging instead of email.
Hoax	A hoax is a type of malicious email with some type of urgent or alarming message to deceive the target.

Manipulation Tactics
Manipulation Type	Description
Moral obligation	Exploits the target’s willingness to be helpful. exploits the victim's willingness to be helpful and assist them out of responsibility
Innate human trust	Exploit a target’s natural tendency to trust others. Right clothes, right demeanor, familiar words and terms.
Threatening	Intimidation into compliance. Useful when moral obligation and innate human trust tactics are ineffective.
Offering something for very little to nothing	promising huge rewards if the target is willing to do a very small favor, i.e. piece of seemingly trivial information.
Ignorance	target doesn't recognize social engineering when it is happening because they are uneducated. 
Social Engineering Process
Phase	Description
Research	Gathers information about the target organization. 
•	footprinting, takes advantage of all resources available to gain information. 
1.	going through official websites and social media; performing dumpster diving; 
2.	searching sources for employees’ names, email addresses, and IDs; 
3.	going through a tour of the organization 
Provide information for pretexting, to perform an unauthorized action such as providing server names and login information-believability.
Development	1.	selecting individual targets within organization and form relationship. access to the desired information or object, 
•	signs of being frustrated, overconfident, arrogant, or somehow easy to extract information
2.	Once selected, conversations, emails, shared interests help build the target's trust in the attacker, allowing the targets to be comfortable, relaxed, and more willing to help.
Exploitation	takes advantage of the relationship to extract information, obtain access, etc
•	disclosing password and username
•	introducing the attacker to other personnel to provide social credibility for the attacker
•	inserting a USB flash drive with a malicious payload into a organization's computer
•	Opening an infected email attachment; and exposing trade secrets. 
•	Most tie up loose ends, erasing digital footprints and ensuring no items or information are left behind for the target/ to ID attacker. 
•	well-planned and smooth exit strategy

Techniques to extract information from a target without arousing suspicion. 
Tactic
Compliments
Misinformation
Feigning ignorance
Being a good listener

Step	Description
Pretexting	conducting research and information gathering to create convincing identities, stories, and scenarios to be used on selected targets.
Preloading	set up a target by influencing the target’s thoughts, opinions, and emotions.
Impersonation	pretending to be trustworthy and having a legitimate reason for approaching the target to ask for sensitive information or access to protected systems.

Concept	Description
Interview vs interrogation	•	An interview lets the target do the talking.

•	Transitions to interrogation phase, effective when done smoothly and naturally, building connection and trust. 
•	talks about the target's statements. leading the conversation with questions and statements that will flow in the direction of information.
Environment	•	should not be overly noisy or overly crowded.
•	relaxing and stress-free setting 
•	The attacker shouldn’t sit between the target and the door. 
•	Lighting should be good enough for both parties to see each other clearly. This will allow the attacker to better read the target’s micro expressions and movements. It will also inspire trust in the target.
Observation	pays attention to every change the target displays. 



2.3.8 Phishing and Internet-Based Techniques Facts
Phishing:social engineer masquerades as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. 
Attack	Description
Spear phishing	In spear phishing, an attacker gathers information about the victim, such as the online bank. The attacker then sends a phishing email to the victim that appears to be from that bank. Usually, the email contains a link that sends the user to a site that looks legitimate, but is intended to capture the victim's personal information.
Whaling	Whaling is another form of phishing. It targets senior executives and high-profile victims.
Vishing	Vishing is like phishing, but instead of an email, the attacker uses Voice over IP (VoIP) to gain sensitive information. The term is a combination of voice and phishing.
SMS phishing	In SMS phishing (smishing), the attacker sends a text message with a supposedly urgent topic to trick the victim into taking immediate action. The message usually contains a link that either installs malware on the victim's phone or extracts personal information.
Other Social Engineering Attacks
Attack	Description
Pharming	executing malicious programs on the target’s computer so that any URL traffic redirects to the attacker’s malicious website.
lure-less phishing. 
Trojan horses, worms, and similar programs. 
commonly implemented using DNS cache poisoning or host file modification. 
•	In DNS cache poisoning, attack on the chosen DNS serve, changeing the IP address of a legitimate website to a fake website in DNS tables, to force redirect to fake website.
•	In host file modification, the attacker sends malicious code as an email attachment, which executes and modifies the local hosts file on the user’s computer, to force a redirect.
Social networking	Many attackers are turning to applications such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, to steal identities and information. Also, many attackers use social media to scam users. These scams are designed to entice the user to click a link that brings up a malicious site the attacker controls. Usually, the site requests personal information and sensitive data, such as an email address or credit card number.



2.3.10 Investigating a Social Engineering Attack
Attack	Description
email validity	Be wary of emails from unknown organizations or senders and their attachments. A lot of hoax emails are pretty easy to spot because of their bad spelling and terrible grammar, but some of them look very, very real. 
Outlook: File > Properties, you can see the header information right here. As you can tell, this can't be resized, and it's hard to read in this format. The mail client in Windows 10 doesn't have a way to view header information, but don't worry. You can view header information by opening the email in a text editor like I've done with Notepad++. 
verifying websites 	double-check the spelling of the website you're navigating to. also verify a site by viewing the SSL certification information. An SSL certificate (Secure Sockets Layer certificate) is a digital certificate that authenticates the identity of a website and encrypts the information sent to its server using SSL technology.
virus hoaxes	designed to scare or intimidate users into thinking they've contracted some type of virus. Often, there's a number you can call where they'll take payment over the phone for fixing the virus, but they never actually do anything.


2.4 Vulnerability Concerns
Term	Definition
Zero-day vulnerability	Zero-day is a software vulnerability that is unknown to the vendor.
Data loss	The loss of files and documents either accidentally or through malicious acts.
Data breach	The exposure of confidential or protected data, either accidentally or through malicious acts.
Data exfiltration	The unauthorized transfer of information or files from a computer.
Identity theft	A crime in which an attacker commits fraud by using someone else's name or existing accounts to obtain money or to purchase items.
Availability loss	Loss of access to computer resources due to the network being overwhelmed or crashing.

2.4.2 Vulnerability Concerns Facts
Network Vulnerabilities
Vulnerability	Description
Default accounts and passwords	Default accounts and passwords are factory defaults that are pre-configured for a new network device. Default account names and passwords should be changed immediately when hardware or software is turned on for the first time.

Misconfigured access points with lax security can allow an outsider to access a corporate network as if they were a company employee. Training is essential for systems administrators and security professionals to accurately configure devices so that only approved personnel are permitted to access ports, programs, accounts, and devices. 
More recently, in 2017, WannaCry ransomware ransacked the internet, holding peoples' data hostage by taking advantage of default settings in several operating systems that had SMB version 1 enabled by default. 
Hard coded passwords
Weak passwords	Weak passwords are passwords that are blank, too short, dictionary words, or simple. In other words, they are passwords that can be quickly identified using password cracking tools. Password cracking is the process of recovering secret passwords from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system. 
To avoid this vulnerability enforce complex password requirements. Complex passwords are typically over eight characters and a mix of character types (letters, numbers and symbols). Also require that the passwords are not words, variations of words, or derivatives of the user name.
Privilege escalation	Privilege escalation allows a user to take advantage of a software bug or design flaw in an application to gain access to system resources or additional privileges that aren't typically available to that user. Examples of privilege escalation include: 
•	A user who accesses a system with a standard user account but is able to access functions reserved for higher-level user accounts such as administrative features.
•	A user who is able to access content that should be accessible only by a different user.
•	A user with administrative access who can access content that should be available only to a regular user.
Privilege escalation does not occur when a user is able to steal or hack administrator credentials and is therefore able to access administrative functions. Privilege escalation refers to accessing features with an account that normally should not have access to those features.
Backdoor	A backdoor is an unprotected access method or pathway. Backdoors: 
•	Include hard-coded passwords and hidden service accounts.
•	Are often added during development as a shortcut to circumvent security. If they are not removed, they present a security problem.
•	Can be added by attackers who have gained unauthorized access to a device. When added, the backdoor can be used at a future time to easily bypass security controls.
•	Can be used to remotely control the device at a later date.
•	Rely on secrecy to maintain security.
To protect against backdoors, do not allow programmers to bypass security during development. Carefully examine the code before release to remove any traces of backdoors that might have been included.
Cloud-based and third-party systems	When dealing with cloud-based or other third-party systems, you need to make special provisions. If an organization is using a cloud-based system, that means the organization doesn't own the system and cannot legally provide permission for a penetration test to be carried out on that system. The penetration tester must make sure to get the explicit permission of the cloud provider before performing any tests.
Other third-party systems can cause issues for the penetration tester. If systems are interconnected, such as in a supply chain, the penetration tester needs to ensure they do not accidentally access the third party's systems. The penetration tester can also discover vulnerabilities that affect the third party. In this scenario, the penetration tester should report findings to the client and let the client handle the reporting.
As you identify threats and evaluate vulnerabilities, consider risks that can occur at any point in the company's supply chain. The chain typically includes those supplying raw materials; manufacturing products; and selling and distributing the products to end customers.
Inherent vulnerabilities	Identify inherent vulnerabilities or systems that lack proper security controls. For example, if your organization needs to use an older version of Windows for a particular application, then you should identify that system as a vulnerability. IoT and SCADA devices are both systems that lack proper security controls and must be dealt with appropriately.
Application flaws	Flaws in the validation and authorization of users present the greatest threat to security in transactional applications. When you assess this type of vulnerability, evaluate deployment and communication between the server and client. It is imperative to develop tight security through user authorization and validation. You can use both open-source and commercial tools for this assessment.
Misconfigurations	The primary cause of misconfiguration is human error. Web servers, application platforms, databases, and networks are all at risk for unauthorized access. Areas to check include outdated software, unnecessary services, incorrectly authenticated external systems, security settings that have been disabled, and debug enabled on a running application.

If content filters are not used or misconfigured, traffic like SPAM or questionable websites with potentially malicious links or payloads may expose employees to malware attacks that lead to a loss of sensitive data.
Misconfigured access points with lax security can allow an outsider to access a corporate network as if they were a company employee. Training is essential for systems administrators and security professionals to accurately configure devices so that only approved personnel are permitted to access ports, programs, accounts, and devices. 
 For example, in 2014, the Heartbleed bug took advantage of systems with an older version of the popular OpenSSL cryptography library.

Root account	The root account has all system privileges and no barriers. It is also referred to as superuser. To prevent accidental damage to the system, an administrator using root must precisely and expertly perform tasks on the system. Also, the administrator should be the only one using the root account. Because there's no safety net when using root, it's important to make backups of any files or directories you're working with.
Another danger of using root frequently is that most apps and programs have several programming errors (because of the amount of code required and its complexity). An attacker can find and exploit these errors to gain control of a system when a program runs with root privileges instead of an ordinary user account, which has very limited privileges.
To avoid unnecessary risk, use the root account only when absolutely necessary. This includes experienced administrators. Have administrators log in with the admin account and use the su command. This command gives root privileges only as needed, without requiring a new login.
protecting physical access to individual components. If an attacker can gain physical access, typically, they can reset passwords and enter the critical systems of an infrastructure.

Ensuring that only specific software and services are allowed on your infrastructure and changing the default passwords and configurations will cut down on exploits. Have some physical security measures
CVE, database is a popular repository hosted by MITRE Corporation. On this database, security professionals can download lists of known CVEs, submit new findings, and update information about an existing CVE. NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, also maintains a national vulnerability database. 


2.4.4 Impact of Vulnerabilities Facts
Impacts of Vulnerabilities
Impact	Description
Data loss	Data loss is often caused by a virus or malware. Data loss is particularly problematic because it’s hard to detect the extent of the loss and it’s costly for businesses to repair damaged files. because losing files means losing time and money. Physical damage and formatting errors can also make data unreadable by both humans and software. Losing files and documents usually has a lasting financial impact as well. 
If sensitive data is stolen or compromised, this news is communicated to clients, and you'll lose their trust and respect. After recovering from the data loss, businesses always need to rebuild client relationships.

many steps, such as employee education and regularly checking the network for unusual activity. 

Data breach	Data breach occurs when confidential or protected data is exposed. Examples of confidential information include Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, credit card numbers numbers, health information, passwords, and email. Data breach allows criminals to access sensitive information and profit from it. It can be intentional or accidental.
Data exfiltration	Data exfiltration occurs when information or files are transferred from a computer without authorization. It can be done manually, if the attacker has physical access to the computer; or, it can be automated over a network by an attacker using malware. A common tactic attackers use for data exfiltration is DNS tunneling. so make sure to implement a good DNS threat analytics solution. 
Identity theft	Identity theft refers to an attacker accessing information to commit fraud. Examples of fraud include creating false credentials, opening new accounts in someone else's name, or using someone's existing accounts. Many attackers use data breach to get the information they need to commit identity theft. There are several types of identity theft such as criminal, medical, tax, and child identity theft.
Availability loss	Availability loss occurs when an attacker performs a malicious act to make the network so busy that the system goes down. This is also referred to as denial of service. When this happens, employees are unable to accomplish their tasks. Also, customers are unable to access the company’s services. Loss of availability can be accomplished with malware.
