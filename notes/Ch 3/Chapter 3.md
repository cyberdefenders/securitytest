| Physical security                | Physical security is the protection of corporate assets from threats such as unauthorized entry, theft or damage.  Prevention: making the location less tempting to break into. Detection: identifying what was broken into, what is missing, and the extent of the damage. Recovery: review of the physical security procedures, repairing any damage, and hardening the physical security of the company against future problems.  Restricting physical access to facilities and computer systems. Preventing interruptions of computer services caused by problems such as loss of power or fire. Preventing unauthorized disclosure of information. Disposing of sensitive material. Protecting the interior and exterior of your facility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Perimeter security               | A low fence (3-4 feet) acts as a deterrent to casual intrusion. A higher fence (6-7 feet) acts as a deterrent unless the trespasser has a specific intent to violate security. A fence 8 feet or higher topped with barbed wire is an effective deterrent. Barricades can be erected to prevent vehicles from approaching the facility. Bollards are short, sturdy posts used to prevent a car from crashing into a secure area. Signs should be posted to inform individuals that they are entering a secured area. Guard dogs are generally highly reliable, but are appropriate only for physical perimeter security. They can be expensive to keep and maintain. Their use might raise issues of liability and insurance. Lighting deters casual intruders, helps guards see intruders, and is necessary for most cameras to monitor the area. To be effective, lights should be placed to eliminate shadows or dark spots. Security guards offer the best protection for perimeter security because they can actively respond to a variety of threat situations. Security guards can also reference an access list that explicitly lists who can enter a secure facility.   expensive, require training, and can be unreliable or inconsistent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) | **bullet camera**, which has a built-in lens. It is long and round in shape. Most bullet cameras can be **used indoors or outdoors.** **c-mount camera**, which has interchangeable lenses. It is typically rectangle in shape with the lens on the end. Most c-mount cameras **require a special housing to be used outdoors.** **dome camera**, which is a camera protected with a plastic or glass dome. These cameras are **more vandal-resistant** than other cameras. **pan tilt zoom (PTZ) camera**, which lets you dynamically move the camera and zoom in on specific areas. Cameras without PTZ capabilities are manually set looking toward a specific direction. Automatic PTZ mode automatically moves the camera between several preset locations. A manual PTZ lets an operator remotely control the position of the camera. When selecting cameras, be aware of the following characteristics: The focal length measures the magnification power of a lens. The focal length controls the distance that the camera can see, as well as how much detail can be seen at a specific range. The focal length is expressed in millimeters (mm). A higher focal length lets you see more detail at a greater distance. **Most cameras have a 4 mm lens with a range of 30-35 feet**. This allows you to see facial features at that distance. A fixed lens camera has a set focal length. A varifocal camera lens lets you adjust the focus (zoom). **A 70-degree view angle** is the largest view angle possible without distorting the image. **The resolution is rated in the number of lines (such as 400)** included in the image. In general, the higher the resolution, the sharper the image. LUX is a measure of the sensitivity to light. **The lower the number, the less light is necessary for a clear image.** **Infrared cameras can record images in little or no light**. Infrared cameras have a range of about **25 feet** in no light and further in dimly-lit areas.  |

| Physical access controls         | can include key fobs, swipe cards, or badges. To control access to sensitive areas within the facility, require a card swipe or reader. Some systems can track personnel movement within a facility and proactively lock or unlock doors based on the access token device. An anti-passback system prevents a card holder from passing their card back to someone else. Physical controls are often implemented along with sensors and alarms to detect unauthorized access**.

| Temperature                         | Reduces lifespan or reliability Fans and cooling systems usually adequate  Server rooms require special cooling systems. The optimum temperature for computer equipment is 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 Celsius). Temperature sensors are generally located one-half to two feet above the floor and five to six feet above the floor throughout the room. A variation of more than 12 degrees between low-mounted and high-mounted sensors indicates a problem. HVAC controls the temperature and humidity of a building. HVAC keeps temperatures cool for computer systems. Computer systems and server rooms should be centrally located and have separate ducting for better controls. Computer rooms/server rooms require full-time environmental controls. Use positive pressure systems for energy efficiency and to avoid outside contaminants.  Protect filtered air intakes against sabotage and contamination. keep electronic components between 70 and 74 degrees and humidity between 40% and 65%. Ensure that appropriate personnel has access to shut-off valves for HVAC system. **cold aisle is created by having the front of the equipment face toward the center of the aisle. Hot aisles have the back of the equipment face the aisle.**   Air from the cooling system is forced into the cool aisles from underneath and exhausted through the hot aisles overhead. Typically, cold aisles face air conditioner output ducts and hot aisles face air conditioner return ducts.   Install internal fans to bring air into, or exhaust air out of, individual units to act with the overall pattern of airflow in the center. Locate devices with side or top exhausts in their own part of the datacenter. Raise the floor 1.5 feet so that air being pushed by air conditioning equipment can pass through. Install automatic doors in the data center.                                                                                                                    |
| Humidity                            | kept within 40 to 65 percent. Too much humidity results in condensation. **Too little humidity results in electrostatic discharge (ESD**).  Avoid large, rapid changes in humidity. Keeping a narrow range of temperature in the computer room will help to avoid condensation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Airflow                             | Fans are a critical component in preventing hot spots in a computer room. There are two types of fans, fans inside the computer equipment and room fans, which circulate air in the room. The air exchange rate for a computer room is much higher than for an office area. **An office area needs approximately two air changes per hour. A server room needs between 20 and 30 air changes per hour.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Power Conditions                    | **A surge or spike** in power is a sudden rise in voltage. It can be caused by a lightning strike; a power plant coming online or going off-line; or even equipment inside the facility. **A sag or dip** in power is a reduction in voltage for a short period of time (up to as long as a few seconds). Sources of sags or dips include chained power strips, faulty wiring, sudden power draws (such as when equipment is first turned on), and large inductive sources, such as an electric motor. **A brownout** is a reduction in voltage that lasts longer than a few seconds. A brownout is generally caused at the utility company during times of high-power usage. The ANSI standard defines a brownout as **an 8% drop between the power source and the voltage meter or a 3.5% drop between the voltage meter and the wall outlet.** **A blackout** is a complete power failure. A blackout can have a variety of sources, such as downed power lines or failed transformers. **A fault** is a momentary power outage that can have a variety of sources. **A transient** is a fluctuation caused by line noise or disturbance. **Surge protectors** protect against spikes that damage components. Many power strips have a built-in surge protector. **Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) protect against under-voltage conditions of short duration (depending on battery life, 30 minutes or more). Most UPS systems include a line conditioner and a surge protector.** **A redundant power source** can ensure constant power. An example of a redundant power source is a backup generator or power from a secondary source in case the primary source fails. Backup generators require fuel to operate and can provide power to critical systems until the fuel is consumed. **Line conditioners, also known as power conditioners**, can improve the quality of the power by providing **filters to remove noise, temporary voltage regulators, and surge protectors.** |
| Water or Gas                        | Have the ability to turn them off in the event of a broken pipe, fire, etc. Identify the location of a master shut-off valve. Identify the location of any secondary shut-off valves. Using secondary shutoff valves minimizes the impact of the service loss. Ensure that the shut-off valves work. Mark shut-off valves to increase visibility. Ensure that appropriate personnel has access to shut-off values for water and gas systems. Secure shut-off valves from general access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
