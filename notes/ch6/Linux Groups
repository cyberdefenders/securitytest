  - Add new group: groupadd (name of group)
  - Modify group name: groupmod -n (new name) (old name)
  - -p defines the password
  - gpasswrd changes password
  - gpasswrd -r deletes password
  - -r recreates a system goup
  - Newgrp changes group id during login session
- **Add user to group**
  - Modify user instead of group and add user to the group
  - –g used to modify primary group of a user
  - -G is used to modify a supplementary group
  - Each user has one and ONLY one primary group
  - If used alone, --G will remove all the supplementary groups with the new one added. Use –G -a to add a user to a group instead of replacing them
  - Example: usermod –G (name of group) -a (name of user)
- **Remove group**
  - groupdel (name of group)
  - Must remove the user from the group before deleting the users primary group
